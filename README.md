# Spec2 Roassal Sequence
I am a Roassal representation of a sequence with arrowed shapes that can be used with Spec2.


Evaluate this code in a Playground to load the project and Roassal3:

```Smalltalk
Metacello new
    baseline: 'SpecRoassalSequence';
    repository: 'github://ClotildeToullec/SpecRoassalSequence';
    load.
